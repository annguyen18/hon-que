HonQue is a healthcare chatbot targeting various individuals in the community and healthcare businesses. Health issues nowadays are a concern for many people across different age groups.

With the advancement of AI software today, HonQue chatbot will help enhance the community's awareness of self-care and assist users in recognizing signs of serious illnesses without the need to directly visit healthcare centers. This enables early detection and timely implementation of appropriate treatment activities.

HonQue chatbot focuses on three main features, serving two distinct customer groups: the  and the professional customer group.


1. USING OPENAI API
   With the utilization of the OpenAI API, HonQue possesses the capability to effectively address      user inquiries and provide responses in a seamless manner, all through the input of text data.      This advanced functionality empowers HonQue to engage with users and cater to their specific        needs, whether they belong to the community customer group or the professional customer group.
  
   For the community customer group, HonQue serves as a valuable health companion, offering            support and guidance on various health-related topics. Users can seek advice on general             wellness, preventive measures, lifestyle modifications, and self-care practices. HonQue can         provide information on healthy habits, nutrition, exercise routines, mental well-being, and more.

2. SKIN LESION ANALYZER FEATURE
   Indeed, this is a practical application of AI in image processing. With input in the form of        images that users can upload from their photo albums or capture in real time, HonQue can            identify potential diseases that users may be afflicted with. By leveraging advanced image          recognition and machine learning algorithms, HonQue can analyze the visual content of the images    and provide insights into possible health conditions.

   In this competition, we have decided to focus on the task of skin cancer detection, as it is a      disease with symptoms that can easily be overlooked. Additionally, training the model with the      HAM10000 dataset has demonstrated that this model can be applied to various other datasets as       well. The core AI technology can be applied universally across different datasets and scenarios.

3. SPEAKER VERIFICATION LOCKER
   Due to the sensitive nature of health issues and associated data, HonQue chatbot has implemented    a voice-based feature as a locker. This feature allows users, especially elderly individuals, to    interact with electronic devices more easily using their voice. For business customers, the         addition of the locker feature ensures that only authorized users can access specific data and      request history.

   By incorporating voice interaction, HonQue enhances accessibility and user experience for           individuals who may find it challenging to navigate traditional interfaces. Voice commands          enable a more intuitive and natural way of interacting with the chatbot, reducing barriers and      making it more user-friendly, particularly for elderly users who may prefer voice-based             interactions.

   The locker feature adds an extra layer of security and privacy to sensitive health data. It         ensures that only authorized individuals with the necessary permissions can access certain data     and request histories. This is particularly important for business customers who handle             sensitive health information and need to maintain strict control over data access and security.

   By implementing these features, HonQue aims to address the unique needs of different customer       groups, providing a secure and user-friendly platform for health-related interactions. The voice-based interaction and locker feature not only improve accessibility but also prioritize the             confidentiality and privacy of sensitive health data, fostering trust and confidence among users.
