HonQue is a healthcare chatbot targeting various individuals in the community and healthcare businesses. Health issues nowadays are a concern for many people across different age groups.

With the advancement of AI software today, HonQue chatbot will help enhance the community's awareness of self-care and assist users in recognizing signs of serious illnesses without the need to directly visit healthcare centers. This enables early detection and timely implementation of appropriate treatment activities.

HonQue chatbot focuses on three main features, serving two distinct customer groups: the  and the professional customer group.


1. USING OPENAI API
   With the utilization of the OpenAI API, HonQue possesses the capability to effectively address      user inquiries and provide responses in a seamless manner, all through the input of text data.      This advanced functionality empowers HonQue to engage with users and cater to their specific        needs, whether they belong to the community customer group or the professional customer group.
  
   For the community customer group, HonQue serves as a valuable health companion, offering            support and guidance on various health-related topics. Users can seek advice on general             wellness, preventive measures, lifestyle modifications, and self-care practices. HonQue can         provide information on healthy habits, nutrition, exercise routines, mental well-being, and more.

2. SKIN LESION ANALYZER FEATURE
   Indeed, this is a practical application of AI in image processing. With input in the form of        images that users can upload from their photo albums or capture in real time, HonQue can            identify potential diseases that users may be afflicted with. By leveraging advanced image          recognition and machine learning algorithms, HonQue can analyze the visual content of the images    and provide insights into possible health conditions.

   In this competition, we have decided to focus on the task of skin cancer detection, as it is a      disease with symptoms that can easily be overlooked. Additionally, training the model with the      HAM10000 dataset has demonstrated that this model can be applied to various other datasets as       well. The core AI technology can be applied universally across different datasets and scenarios.
